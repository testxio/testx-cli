Your new [testx](http://testx.io/testx) project
====================

## Install dependencies
Install all dependencies. In the project directory do:

	npm install

## Run
From within the project directory:

	protractor conf.coffee

or

	npm test

## Next steps
The sample testx script is in **scripts/my-first-test.testx**. Change it to do something more useful and run it again.

[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) configuration (your starting point) is in **conf.js**.

Check the [testx documentation](http://testx.io/testx) documentation to find out where to go from here.

## Editor support
Use [the atom testx language plugin](https://atom.io/packages/language-testx) for syntax highlights and auto-completion. If you do not use [Atom](https://atom.io) you are on your own. But seriously, you should.
